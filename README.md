# Paperclip Pro

**Paperclip Pro is a hard fork of [`paperclipai/paperclip`](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip), branched at upstream commit `7b7c4d417`. It is not an upstream release and is not endorsed by Paperclip Labs, Inc.**

It is maintained independently at [`tickernelz/paperclip-pro`](https://github.com/tickernelz/paperclip-pro). All 32 workspace packages are renamed under the `@tickernelz/paperclip-pro` scope, the CLI binary is `paperclip-pro`, and instance state lives under `~/.paperclip-pro` instead of `~/.paperclip` — so this fork installs and runs beside an upstream instance instead of replacing it.

The fork tracks no upstream release cadence and publishes nothing to the npm registry. Install it from this git repository; see [Quickstart](#quickstart). Report fork bugs in this repository, never in the upstream tracker.

## What this fork changes

Everything below is on `main` and absent from upstream `7b7c4d417`.

| Change | Where |
| --- | --- |
| **First-party `omp_local` adapter.** Runs the local Oh My Pi (OMP) coding-agent CLI as a Paperclip agent runtime: server execution, CLI event formatting, model discovery through `omp models --json`, and a UI transcript parser. | [`packages/adapters/omp-local`](packages/adapters/omp-local); registered at `server/src/adapters/registry.ts:133` and `server/src/adapters/builtin-adapter-types.ts:16` |
| **`uiParserPath` for statically registered adapters.** `GET /api/adapters/:type/ui-parser.js` used to answer 404 for every built-in adapter because the loader only consulted the external plugin store. | `packages/adapter-utils/src/types.ts:462`, `server/src/adapters/plugin-loader.ts:74`, `server/src/routes/adapters.ts:768` |
| **Sandboxed transcript parser worker survives global lockdown.** Plain `self.fetch = undefined` assignments failed on read-only worker globals and took the worker down; denied globals are now installed through `Object.defineProperty` inside `try`/`catch`. | `ui/src/adapters/sandboxed-parser-worker.ts:46`–`ui/src/adapters/sandboxed-parser-worker.ts:55` |
| **A clean shutdown no longer parks issues.** A graceful stop has a known provider outcome, so only genuine process loss still earns a reconciliation hold. | `server/src/services/legacy-execution-recovery.ts:14`, `server/src/services/legacy-execution-recovery.ts:29` |
| **Runs this server interrupted during shutdown are rescheduled** instead of refused as process loss; native runtimes stay suspended. | `server/src/services/heartbeat.ts:14325`, `server/src/services/heartbeat.ts:14327` |
| **Interrupt acknowledgement is read from the full result JSON.** The safe 64 KiB projection strips `executionCancellation`, so a successful adapter interrupt on an oversized run was reported to the UI as a termination conflict. | `server/src/services/heartbeat.ts:28820` |
| **`service restart --drain` plus a live-run guard.** Restart and stop refuse while agent runs are executing unless you drain or force. | `cli/src/commands/service.ts:210`, `cli/src/commands/service.ts:282`–`cli/src/commands/service.ts:284`, `cli/src/services/instance-drain.ts:128` |
| **Isolated home.** `PAPERCLIP_HOME` defaults to `~/.paperclip-pro`; config, embedded Postgres, logs, storage, and backups all resolve under `~/.paperclip-pro/instances/<id>`. | `packages/shared/src/home-paths.ts:16`–`packages/shared/src/home-paths.ts:19`, `packages/shared/src/config-schema.ts:27` |
| **Per-instance `EnvironmentFile` in the systemd unit.** `ensureCurrent()` rewrites the unit on every install, start, and restart, so operator environment used to be lost; the unit now sources an optional `<instanceRoot>/service.env` the CLI never overwrites. | `cli/src/services/service-manager.ts:126`, `cli/src/services/service-manager.ts:149` |

Operators: read [`docs/fork/OPERATIONS.md`](docs/fork/OPERATIONS.md).

Open-source orchestration for teams of AI agents.

**If OpenClaw is an _employee_, Paperclip is the _company_.**

Paperclip is a Node.js server and React UI that orchestrates a team of AI agents to run a business. Bring your own agents, assign goals, and track work and costs from one dashboard.

It looks like a task manager. Under the hood: org charts, budgets, governance, goal alignment, and agent coordination.

**Manage business goals, not pull requests.**

|        | Step            | Example                                                            |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **01** | Define the goal | _"Build the #1 AI note-taking app to $1M MRR."_                    |
| **02** | Hire the team   | CEO, CTO, engineers, designers, marketers — any bot, any provider. |
| **03** | Approve and run | Review strategy. Set budgets. Hit go. Monitor from the dashboard.  |

## Paperclip is right for you if

- ✅ You want to build **autonomous AI organizations**
- ✅ You **coordinate many different agents** (OpenClaw, Codex, Claude, Cursor) toward a common goal
- ✅ You have **20 simultaneous Claude Code terminals** open and lose track of what everyone is doing
- ✅ You want agents running **autonomously 24/7**, but still want to audit work and chime in when needed
- ✅ You want to **monitor costs** and enforce budgets
- ✅ You want a process for managing agents that **feels like using a task manager**
- ✅ You want to manage your autonomous businesses **from your phone**

<br/>

## The four pillars

Four things have to work for an organization of AI agents to actually produce: the tasks, the org, the training, and the infrastructure. Paperclip is built around exactly those four pillars.

| Pillar | Built for | What it covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agentic Task Manager** — Declare intent. Agents work. You verify the output. | Everyone, daily | Tasks, approvals & review gates · proactive agent coworkers · auditable routines & workflows · verify from diffs, screenshots & tests |
| **Org Chart for Agents** — Roles, permissions & boundaries for humans and agents. | Managers | Mixed human + agent org chart · responsibilities, delegation, specialization · governance: who can do what · scoped secrets & company boundaries |
| **Agent Employee Training** — Design, train & evaluate your AI employees. | Enablers | Skill Studio & shared org-wide skills · evals & saved test runs · active learning loops & quality metrics · performance reviews for agents |
| **Agentic OS** — The infrastructure that makes the work run. | IT & platform | Cross-provider runtime: any model, any agent · sandboxing, integrations & MCP servers · SSO, GRC, RBAC & cost controls · data privacy, internal trace collection, compounding data value |

## Problems Paperclip solves

| Without Paperclip                                                                                                                     | With Paperclip                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ You have 20 Claude Code tabs open and can't track which one does what. On reboot you lose everything.                              | ✅ Tasks are ticket-based, conversations are threaded, sessions persist across reboots.                                                |
| ❌ You manually gather context from several places to remind your bot what you're actually doing.                                     | ✅ Context flows from the task up through the project and company goals — your agent always knows what to do and why.                  |
| ❌ Folders of agent configs are disorganized and you're re-inventing task management, communication, and coordination between agents. | ✅ Paperclip gives you org charts, ticketing, delegation, and governance out of the box — so you run a company, not a pile of scripts. |
| ❌ Runaway loops waste hundreds of dollars of tokens and max your quota before you even know what happened.                           | ✅ Cost tracking surfaces token budgets and throttles agents when they're out. Management prioritizes with budgets.                    |
| ❌ You have recurring jobs (customer support, social, reports) and have to remember to manually kick them off.                        | ✅ Heartbeats handle regular work on a schedule. Management supervises.                                                                |
| ❌ You have an idea, you have to find your repo, fire up Claude Code, keep a tab open, and babysit it.                                | ✅ Add a task in Paperclip. Your coding agent works on it until it's done. Management reviews their work.                              |

<br/>

## Why Paperclip is special

Paperclip handles the hard orchestration details correctly.

|                                   |                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Atomic execution.**             | Task checkout and budget enforcement are atomic, so no double-work and no runaway spend.                      |
| **Persistent agent state.**       | Agents resume the same task context across heartbeats instead of restarting from scratch.                     |
| **Runtime skill injection.**      | Agents can learn Paperclip workflows and project context at runtime, without retraining.                      |
| **Governance with rollback.**     | Approval gates are enforced, config changes are revisioned, and bad changes can be rolled back safely.        |
| **Goal-aware execution.**         | Tasks carry full goal ancestry so agents consistently see the "why," not just a title.                        |
| **Portable company templates.**   | Export/import orgs, agents, and skills with secret scrubbing and collision handling.                          |
| **True multi-organization isolation.** | Every entity is company-scoped, so one deployment can run many companies with separate data and audit trails. |

<br/>

## What's Under the Hood

Paperclip is a full control plane, not a wrapper. Before you build any of this yourself, know that it already exists:

### The Systems

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Identity & Access** — Two deployment modes (trusted local or authenticated), board users, agent API keys, short-lived run JWTs, company memberships, invite flows, and OpenClaw onboarding. Every mutating request is traced to an actor.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Org Chart & Agents** — Agents have roles, titles, reporting lines, permissions, and budgets. Adapter examples match the diagram: Claude Code, Codex, CLI agents such as Cursor/Gemini/bash, HTTP/webhook bots such as OpenClaw, and external adapter plugins. If it can receive a heartbeat, it's hired.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Work & Task System** — Issues carry company/project/goal/parent links, atomic checkout with execution locks, first-class blocker dependencies, comments, documents, attachments, work products, labels, and inbox state. No double-work, no lost context.

</td>
<td>

**Heartbeat Execution** — DB-backed wakeup queue with coalescing, budget checks, workspace resolution, secret injection, skill loading, and adapter invocation. Runs produce structured logs, cost events, session state, and audit trails. Recovery handles orphaned runs automatically.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Workspaces & Runtime** — Project workspaces, isolated execution workspaces (git worktrees, operator branches), and runtime services (dev servers, preview URLs). Agents work in the right directory with the right context every time.

</td>
<td>

**Governance & Approvals** — Board approval workflows, execution policies with review/approval stages, decision tracking, budget hard-stops, agent pause/resume/terminate, and full audit logging. Nothing ships without your sign-off.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Budget & Cost Control** — Token and cost tracking by company, agent, project, goal, issue, provider, and model. Scoped budget policies with warning thresholds and hard stops. Overspend pauses agents and cancels queued work automatically.

</td>
<td>

**Routines & Schedules** — Recurring tasks with cron, webhook, and API triggers. Concurrency and catch-up policies. Each routine execution creates a tracked issue and wakes the assigned agent — no manual kick-offs needed.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Plugins** — Instance-wide plugin system with out-of-process workers, capability-gated host services, job scheduling, tool exposure, and UI contributions. Extend Paperclip without forking it.

</td>
<td>

**Secrets & Storage** — Instance and company secrets, encrypted local storage, provider-backed object storage, attachments, and work products. Sensitive values stay out of prompts unless a scoped run explicitly needs them.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Activity & Events** — Mutating actions, heartbeat state changes, cost events, approvals, comments, and work products are recorded as durable activity so operators can audit what happened and why.

</td>
<td>

**Company Portability** — Export and import entire organizations — agents, skills, projects, routines, and issues — with secret scrubbing and collision handling. One deployment, many companies, complete data isolation.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## What Paperclip is not

|                              |                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Not a chatbot.**           | Agents have jobs, not chat windows.                                                                                  |
| **Not an agent framework.**  | We don't tell you how to build agents. We tell you how to run a company made of them.                                |
| **Not a workflow builder.**  | No drag-and-drop pipelines. Paperclip models companies — with org charts, goals, budgets, and governance.            |
| **Not a prompt manager.**    | Agents bring their own prompts, models, and runtimes. Paperclip manages the organization they work in.               |
| **Not a single-agent tool.** | This is for teams. If you have one agent, you probably don't need Paperclip. If you have twenty — you definitely do. |
| **Not a code review tool.**  | Paperclip orchestrates work, not pull requests. Bring your own review process.                                       |

<br/>

## Quickstart

Open source. Self-hosted. No Paperclip account required.

This fork is not published to npm: `npm view @tickernelz/paperclip-pro` returns 404, and `https://paperclip.ing/install.sh` installs **upstream**, not this fork. Install from git.

**Requirements:** Node.js 24.11+ (`package.json` `engines`), pnpm 9.15.4 (`packageManager`), `git`, `curl`, `tar`, and `corepack`.

### 1. Bootstrap the CLI from a source checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tickernelz/paperclip-pro.git
cd paperclip-pro
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm paperclip-pro --help
```

### 2. Install a managed payload from this repository

`install` builds the given git ref into `~/.paperclip-pro/cli` and writes the `paperclip-pro` shim to `~/.local/bin`. `--ref` is mandatory for a git install and `--repo` defaults to the upstream repository (`cli/src/commands/install.ts:27`), so both flags are required here:

```bash
pnpm paperclip-pro install --repo tickernelz/paperclip-pro --ref main --yes
```

Pin an exact commit instead of a branch when you want a reproducible install; `--ref` accepts a branch, tag, or SHA (`cli/src/commands/install.ts:139`-`cli/src/commands/install.ts:147`). `--ref` cannot be combined with `--canary` or `--version`, both of which resolve against npm and therefore do not work for this fork.

### 3. Onboard

```bash
paperclip-pro onboard --yes
```

`onboard` defaults to trusted local loopback. For authenticated/private mode choose a bind preset explicitly:

```bash
paperclip-pro onboard --yes --bind lan
paperclip-pro onboard --yes --bind tailnet
```

Rerunning `onboard` keeps an existing config; use `paperclip-pro configure` to edit settings. To install the background service, use `paperclip-pro onboard --install-service` or `paperclip-pro service install`.

### Or run straight from the checkout

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts the API server at `http://localhost:3100`. An embedded PostgreSQL database is created automatically — no setup required.

Day-two operation of an installed instance (state layout, safe restarts, backups, new admins, sandboxed test runs) is documented in [`docs/fork/OPERATIONS.md`](docs/fork/OPERATIONS.md).

<br/>

## FAQ

**What does a typical setup look like?**
Locally, a single Node.js process manages an embedded Postgres and local file storage. For production, point it at your own Postgres and deploy however you like. Configure projects, agents, and goals — the agents take care of the rest.

If you're a solo entrepreneur you can use Tailscale to access Paperclip on the go. Then later you can deploy to e.g. Vercel when you need it.

**Can I run multiple companies?**
Yes. A single deployment can run an unlimited number of companies with complete data isolation.

**How is Paperclip different from agents like OpenClaw or Claude Code?**
Paperclip _uses_ those agents. It orchestrates them into a company — with org charts, budgets, goals, governance, and accountability.

**Why should I use Paperclip instead of just pointing my OpenClaw to Asana or Trello?**
Agent orchestration has subtleties in how you coordinate who has work checked out, how to maintain sessions, monitoring costs, establishing governance - Paperclip does this for you.

(Bring-your-own-ticket-system is on the Roadmap)

**Do agents run continuously?**
By default, agents run on scheduled heartbeats and event-based triggers (task assignment, @-mentions). You can also hook in continuous agents like OpenClaw. You bring your agent and Paperclip coordinates.

<br/>

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev              # Full dev (API + UI, watch mode)
pnpm dev:once         # Full dev without file watching
pnpm dev:server       # Server only
pnpm dev:mobile       # Serve prebuilt UI on :3101 for phones/tablets (proxies /api → :3100)
pnpm dev:both         # Run `pnpm dev` and `pnpm dev:mobile` together
pnpm build            # Build all
pnpm typecheck        # Type checking
pnpm test             # Cheap default test run (Vitest only)
pnpm test:watch       # Vitest watch mode
pnpm test:e2e         # Playwright browser suite
pnpm db:generate      # Generate DB migration
pnpm db:migrate       # Apply migrations
```

`pnpm test` does not run Playwright. Browser suites stay separate and are typically run only when working on those flows or in CI.

See [doc/DEVELOPING.md](doc/DEVELOPING.md) for the full development guide.

## Observability

Paperclip ships with opt-in OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation for the server (traces only). It activates when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set and supports `grpc`, `http/protobuf`, and `http/json` via the standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` env var. `@opentelemetry/api` is a normal server dependency; the SDK, auto-instrumentation, and exporter packages are optional peer dependencies — install them only if you want tracing. See [doc/observability.md](doc/observability.md) for install commands and the full env-var reference.

Paperclip also ships with opt-in Sentry error monitoring for the server and the browser. Set `SENTRY_DSN_FRONTEND` to activate it for the browser and `SENTRY_DSN_BACKEND` to activate it for the server — each variable is optional, and the legacy `SENTRY_DSN` variable still works as a fallback for either component. The supported server SDK version is `@sentry/node@10.71.0`; it is an optional peer dependency for the server, so install it only if you want error monitoring. The browser SDK, `@sentry/browser`, is pinned to the same exact version. See [doc/observability.md](doc/observability.md#sentry-error-monitoring) for the install command, the privacy settings, and the full default capture set.

## Telemetry

Paperclip collects anonymous usage telemetry to help us understand how the product is used and improve it. No personal information, issue content, prompts, file paths, or secrets are ever collected. Private repository references are hashed with a per-install salt before being sent.

Contributors changing emitted telemetry events should follow the [Telemetry Data Contract](packages/shared/src/telemetry/README.md).
For proposed first-party events that are not in the generated contract yet, follow [Telemetry Workflow](doc/TELEMETRY_WORKFLOW.md).

Telemetry is **enabled by default** and can be disabled with any of the following:

| Method               | How                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Environment variable | `PAPERCLIP_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`                        |
| Standard convention  | `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`                                        |
| CI environments      | Automatically disabled when `CI=true`                   |
| Config file          | Set `telemetry.enabled: false` in your Paperclip config |
